# vail-snow-visualization

This is a full-width story template for a data visualization and story.

It uses the Javascript D3.js library for five graphs. A couple of the graphs borrow generously from [Mike Bostock's multi-line chart Observable notebook](https://observablehq.com/@d3/multi-line-chart).

It uses a version of [Brendan Sudol's Responsivefy](https://brendansudol.com/writing/responsive-d3) to make the graphics mobile-responsive.

The scrollytelling utilizes CSS Position:Sticky [as demonstrated here](https://codepen.io/enatario/pen/GGqepe).
