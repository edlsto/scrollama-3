        <p>VAIL &#8212; Large amounts of snowpack still linger in the high country, setting up a late and strong water peak for local rivers. Thanks to a cool and wet spring, river flows are still relatively modest for this time of year.</p>
        <p>Despite the snowy winter and wet spring, as of Monday, the Eagle River below Gypsum was running at 1,570 cubic feet per second. That's the third-lowest amount for June 3 in the last 10 years.</p>
        <p>The river at that spot has peaked at as high as 6,160 CFS, which happened on June 7, 2010. The latest it has peaked in the last decade is in 2011, when it peaked July 8 at 4,950 CFS.</p>
        <p>The lowest and earliest peak in the last decade was in 2012, when the river peaked at 1,230 CFS on May 23, 2012.</p>

        <p>There is still plenty of snow in high-elevation areas. As of June 3, Vail Mountain still had 23 inches of snowpack at its SNOTEL station. This year is the first time in the last seven years that there was snow at that recording station as of June 3.</p>
        <p>In the leanest snow year in the past decade, 2012, the snowpack on Vail Mountain had zeroed out by April 7.</p>
        <p>The snowpack's highest level in the last 10 years was 84 inches deep on April 30 in 2010.</p>

        <p>During the ski season, Vail Mountain recorded at total of 281 inches &#8212; a solid amount, but not close to the 10-year high of 459 inches in 2011.</p>
        <p>But 2018-19 did receive a whopping 64 percent more snow than the previous year.</p>
        <p>The most pathetic snow year in the last 10 years was 2012, when Vail Mountain notched just 164 inches of snow.</p>

        <p>If you were skiing on March 4, consider yourself lucky &#8212; that was the biggest powder day of the year on Vail Mountain with 15 inches recorded.</p>
        <p>The biggest snow week of the year was March 3-9, which notched 48 inches.</p>
        <p>The driest week of the season was the very last &#8212; a stretch of seven goose eggs for the only time in the season.</p>

        <p>If you thought Vail had a great season, check out some other resorts. Mammoth topped 400 inches by early March.</p>
        <p>Aspen, Park City and Breckenridge also trended higher than Vail as the season progressed.</p>
